    description: "In 2011 I fell in love with fashion tech, inspired by designers like Hussein Chalayan and CuteCircuit. I became determined to create the interactive wearable art of my dreams and with the help of mentors and family built several prototypes, the last of which I wore to Senior Prom in 2015. The project includes an iOS application in Objective C, an Android application in Java, a wearable control hub with a custom PCB and bluetooth capability inside a lasercut enclosure with heatsink, and a set of modular fashion pieces to which the controlled LED strips can be attached. I'm incredibly proud of the breadth of skills I acquired while working on this project, though I would do it completely differently if I was to do it again.",

    description: "During my gap year I got the opportunity to attend Comic Con International in San Diego. I knew that I wanted to build a costume for the exhibition, but I wanted to make something that was both super visible and very wearable during the multi-day event going through doors. Following the guidance of online tutorials and the assistance of family, these mechanical wings were build out of light wood and machine screws with feathers made of zipties and butcher paper. Getting the mechanism weighted just right so that it was bistable (open and closed) was a serious challenge, but the final effect was truly worth it.",

I got to a first version of the central component relatively quickly, but was able to improve the design and machine a new piece twice more before the final delivery, leading to a perfect fit.",

The result was this: a waffle cone iron that creates waffle cones in the shape of paper airplanes. The top side is embossed with a woodgrain pattern and the bottom with a geometric pattern. Each groove marks a place in the cone which must be flexible enough to hold a corner. The hot cone is then put in a press and cools into the shape of a paper airplane. There was no reason for this project except to practice manufacturing skills and create something that others can enjoy. I did make the cones complete with ice cream at the project showcase.",

At the end of my internship I got to give a demonstration to the client and watch them use the software for the first time. Today the code that I wrote forms the foundation of a product that now has a team of wonderful engineers who are changing the drone industry as we know it. This internship taught me a ton about issue tracking, version control, and documentation when working on a cross-platform software team.",
